# Langchain

## Chat Models

Chat models are language models that use a sequence of messages as inputs and return messages as output.
We have three types of messages ```System Message```, ```AI Message```, ```Human Message```


1) System Message - sets a broad context of our conversation. eg - Hey, I am a software developer, help me write a for loop".
2) Human Message - this is us talking with the AI.
3) AI Message - this is the AI responding back to us.
